## Create a new bead

Initial setup:
```shell
$ mkdir /somepath/BeadBox
$ bead box add main /somepath/BeadBox
Will remember box main
```
This is where completed beads will be stored. Create an empty bead with name `name`:

    /somepath$ bead new name
    Created name
    
Add some data to the output of this new bead which we can use later. This bead has no computation, only data.

    /somepath$ cd name/
    /somepath/name$ echo World > output/name
    
    /somepath/name$ bead save
    Successfully stored bead.
    
    /somepath/name$ bead nuke
    Deleted workspace /somepath/name

## Working with inputs in a new bead 

Create a new data package:

    /somepath$ bead new hello
    Created hello

    /somepath$ cd hello/

Add data from an existing bead at `input/<input-name>/`:

    /somepath/hello$ bead input add name who-do-i-greet
    name loaded on who-do-i-greet.

Create a program `greet` that produces a greeting, using `input/who-do-i-greet` as an input:

    read name < input/who-do-i-greet/name
    echo "Hello $name!" > output/greeting

Run the program:

    /somepath/hello$ bash greet 

This script has create a text file in `output/greeting`. Let us verify its content:

    /somepath/hello$ cat output/greeting
    Hello World!

## Package the data and send it to an outside collaborator

Save our new bead:

    /somepath/hello$ bead save
    Successfully stored bead.

This stores output, computation and references to inputs. Now the content of `/somepath/BeadBox` is

    /somepath$ ls -1 BeadBox/
    hello_20160527T130218513418+0200.zip
    name_20160527T113419427017+0200.zip

These are regular (and, in this case, small) zip files, which can be transferred by usual means (e.g. emailed) to collaborators. The recipient can process them via the `bead` tool, keep the integrity of provenance information, and adding further dependencies as needed. Even withouth the tool, she can access the data by directly unzipping the file and inspecting its content. 

The output of the computation is stored under `data/*`. An outide collaborator without access to `bead` can just ignore the computation and all other metadata.

    /somepath$ unzip -p BeadBox/hello_20160527T130218513418+0200.zip data/greeting
    Hello World!
    
    /somepath$ unzip -v BeadBox/hello_20160527T130218513418+0200.zip 
    Archive:  BeadBox/hello_20160527T130218513418+0200.zip
		
		This file is a BEAD zip archive.
		
		It is a normal zip file that stores a discrete computation of the form
		
		output = code(*inputs)
		
		The archive contains

		- inputs as part of metadata file: references (content_id) to other BEADs
		- code as files
        - output as files
        - extra metadata to support
        - linking different versions of the same computation
        - determining the newest version
        - reproducing multi-BEAD computation sequences built by a distributed team
